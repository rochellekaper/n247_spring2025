    "# Before we start\n",
    "You've got two good ways of doing all the course material.  The first way is the simplest to get going, but is a bit less flexible, especially down the road. It just needs a web browser and a Google account. Download the course materials onto your Google Drive and you can run everything for the course in a web browser. Just head to [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/) and you'll run everything on one of Google's servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way involves installing two bits of software on your machine. If you actualy move forward with Python in your work, you'll likely want to do this anyway. \n",
    "- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution): Python + data science packages + R + more *or* [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-other-installer-links.html). For Mac folks, you may want to try [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases).  Which of these you pick really doesn't matter. \"Conda\" is just a nice way to acesss Python modules / packages and Anaconda is a one-stop shop that bundles all you'll need. You only need their free license. \n",
    "- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download): A ridiculously good and powerful editor + coding environment.  It plays very well with Jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you really want, you can run in anything that has Python3 + Numpy / Scipy / Pandas and that supports Jupyter notebooks. If you don't know what any of that means or aren't wedded to some setup, give the VSCode + Anaconda setup a go. It's the easiest setup I've found.  If you do go the Miniconda or Miniforge route, you'll start out with a pretty bare setup.  Just type `conda install scipy pandas seaborn icecream ipykernel` into the terminal and it'll install what you need for the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course material\n",
    "The course material is all located on [Github](https://github.com/celstark/n247data). Of course, you've got this here, so you must already know that. If you don't know how git works and don't care to, just download the `.zip` via the green _Code_ button. If you're interested in git / GitHub, but don't want to spend 20 hours learning the difference between forks and branches, just tell **VSCode** to clone the Git repository (I told you it was awesome) or download [Github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). \n",

    "# ChatGPT, zotGPT, and AI tools\n",
    "You may have heard that the large language models of things like ChatGPT can write code for you. You may be tempted to just pass in all the assignments here and let it do them for you.  I've tried it on several of the assignments here and sure, it can nail the first couple of them. Past that though, you start to run into issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is this me saying \"Don't trust ChatGPT!\"?  Well yes, and no.  Is it \"Don't use ChatGPT!\"?  Again, yes and no.  Flash back to the days of yore - maybe 2020. What did students do in the course when they were stuck?  They asked another student or Google and found sourceforge pages that were at least kinda close. They used those results to help them understand the syntax or work through one hurdle and that then helped them move forward.  In effect, they had a reference or a tutor.  *Back in my day...*, sure we didn't have sourceforge. Really, the internet was invented when I was in grad school.  But, I had, and still have on my bookshelf, texts like *Numerical Recipes in C*.  It was an agorithm cheat-code and we all turned to it.\n",

We're doing things that haven't been done before.  AI models are based on knowledge on the web - **existing knowledge**.  Parts of what you need to do may-well have been solved. Small parts surely have.  AI tools are going to be great coaches for things like \"How can I make an N-dimensional array of normal random numbers using numpy\".  Here's what zotGPT returns on that:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create an N-dimensional array of normal random numbers using the `numpy.random.normal` function in Numpy. Here's a general way of doing this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dimensions of the array\n",
    "dims = (dim1, dim2, ..., dimN)  # Replace dim1, dim2, ..., dimN with the size along each dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Parameters for the normal distribution\n",
    "loc = 0.0  # Mean (center) of the distribution\n",
    "scale = 1.0  # Standard deviation (spread or width) of the distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating the N-dimensional array\n",
    "array = np.random.normal(loc, scale, dims)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you want to create a 3-dimensional array of normal random numbers with dimensions 2x3x4, you would do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "dims = (2, 3, 4)\n",
    "loc = 0.0\n",
    "scale = 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "array = np.random.normal(loc, scale, dims)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `array` will be a 3-dimensional array filled with numbers drawn from a normal distribution with mean `loc` and standard deviation `scale`. The shape of the array is defined by `dims`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "So, think of these tools as coaches.  Feed them small bits when you're frustrated or don't understand some part of the problem.  But, how to break up your problem into smaller pieces, how to structure it, etc. is going to be something that you're going to need to learn to do no matter what.\n",
