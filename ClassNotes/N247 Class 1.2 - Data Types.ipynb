So, while we know **1** and **\"one\"** in many ways mean the same thing, they're very different to your program.  The first is a number and the second is a string of three characters.  That may seem obvious (I hope it does), but **1** and **\"1\"**are different as well.  Heck, **1** is not always the same thing as **1.0**.  The former is an integer and the latter a floating point number.

Have an int and want it to be a float?  Want a string of a number?  You can coerce variables into another format so long as you're not going to lose information by using the `int`, `float`, `str`, `list`, etc. functions.  So, I might say:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["a=1\n","b=3.1\n","c='2.3'\n","\n","d=b+float(c)\n","print(d)\n","\n","print(str(a) + ' is less than ' + str(b))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bVM43FOR0HHf"},"source":["# Native Python types we'll use less\n","\n","## Sets\n","\n","Sets, like tuples, are immutable (can't be changed).  But, unlike tuples, they're not ordered.  They're just a group of items you encase in `{}`.  You can do things like union and intersection on them if you're into that sort of thing.\n","\n","\n","## Dictionaries\n","\n","Dictionaries are key-value pairs that are like sets, but indexed nicely by these keys.  You might define one like this:\n","\n","\n","```\n","params = {'ID': 47183,\n","'Duration': 2.0,\n","'ISI':0.5,\n","'TrialOrder': [1,5,2,3,4]}\n","```\n","\n","\n","and then access the ISI portion via `params['ISI']`.  We saw a dictionary in the humansize example:\n","\n","\n","```\n","SUFFIXES = {1000: ['KB', 'MB', 'GB', 'TB', 'PB', 'EB', 'ZB', 'YB'],\n","            1024: ['KiB', 'MiB', 'GiB', 'TiB', 'PiB', 'EiB', 'ZiB', 'YiB']}\n","```\n","\n","\n","So, we have two key-value pairs.  Each key (1000 or 1024) has a value.  That value is a list.  When we wanted the value associated with the 1000 key, we said `SUFFIXES[1000]` and it returned a list.  We could then get the nth value in that list, etc.  Note how in the first example, we used a string as the key and here we used a number. Python is fine with anything really being the key.\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyP2hKOotJaY+NeaSo+Rwqz+","name":"N247 - Class 1.2 - Data Types.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"base","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.16"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"2a285feeb504ac160987d0a5ad6446ca89095681fd4bb3b724de790f0db2ae60"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
