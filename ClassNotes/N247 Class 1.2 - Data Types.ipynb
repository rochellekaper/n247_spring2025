    "\n",
    "Computer languages have the concept of a _data type_ that comes down to the question, _what sort of information am I storing or looking at here?_  Python lets you intermix types more easily than many languages, but we need to have a good understanding of what these data types are and why we'd use one over another.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest split in some ways is between a number and a string of characters.  So, while we know **1** and **\"one\"** in many ways mean the same thing, they're very different to your program.  The first is a number and the second is a string of three characters.  That may seem obvious (I hope it does), but **1** and **\"1\"**are different as well.  Heck, **1** is not always the same thing as **1.0**.  The former is an integer and the latter a floating point number.  Again, Python takes a lot of the hurt out of working with these, but we need to know what they are, how to convert between them, and why we'd care about one or the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Int and float (numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers are \"whole numbers\" and floating point numbers let you have a decimal place. That's the 1 vs. 1.0 noted above.  If you use a number like 10, it assumes you're talking about an integer.  If you give it 10.1, it assumes you're talking about a float.  Python defaults to integers, but will convert on the fly as needed.  This is what makes Python a _dynamically typed_ language.  We'll touch base on dynamic vs. static typing later.\n",
