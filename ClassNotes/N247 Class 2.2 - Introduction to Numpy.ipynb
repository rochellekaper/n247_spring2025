I'll use them interchangeably and truth be told, the first and third of those are the same and `np.array` is a touch different.  The class that NumPy makes for us is called an \"ndarray\" or N-dimensional array.  A standard way of creating an object of this class is to use the function `np.array([1,2,3,4])` or something similar.  You could also create it with `np.zeros(2)` for example to make a 2x2 array of zeros (see below).  In talking about things, I'll equate the terms though as it hardly matters to you and it's a pain to say \"n-d-array\" all the time.  But, if you see things talking about \"ndarray\", it's just the NumPy array we know and love.\n",
