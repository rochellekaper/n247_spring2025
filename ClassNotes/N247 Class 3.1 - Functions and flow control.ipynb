We need to loop code over and over some number of times or for every element on a list, however long that list may be.  We need to be able to break out of these or bail out of functions when things go badly.  All this is flow control.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## If / else / elif\n",
    "\n",
    "If / else-if / else -- the classic branching kind of statement is in every programming language.  Each one has a little different syntax (_else if_ vs. _elseif_ vs. _elsif_ vs. _elif_ for starters...) but the concept is always the same.  Have a look at the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if size > 100:\n",
    "    mode = 1\n",
    "elif size < 50:\n",
    "    mode = 2\n",
    "elif size < 70:\n",
    "    mode = 3\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    mode = 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if _size_=110 our resulting mode will be 1. If it's 40, the first `if` fails and we get to the first `elif`. That succeeds, so our mode is now 2. If size were 60 though, the first `if` fails, the first `elif` fails, but the second `elif` is true so our mode is now 3. Now, if it's 80, our mode gets to be 4. So this code is saying \"above 100 is mode 1; below 50 is mode 2; between 50 and 70 is 3; between 70 and 100 is 4\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about that for a second - in particular that last bit about 70-100 being 4. Because the first `if` failed, we know the value of _size_ is &lt;= 100. None of the other `elif` lines or the `else` is ever even looked at if _size_ > 100. So, we know by virtue of hitting that `else` that _size_ must be under or equal to 100.  Since the first `elif` failed, we know it's not &lt;50.  So a this point, it's 50-100.  But we also know that second one failed and that the value isn't &lt; 70.  So, it must be between 70-100 (note, I'm being lose here with my ranges and the exact values of 50, 70, and 100 to try to keep the text less awkward).\n",
    "\n",
    "You might accomplish the same kind of thing with code like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if size > 100:\n",
    "    mode = 1\n",

    "    mode = 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for doing the former, though, is that you can have some more interesting control.  I the latter version, each `if` is evaluated whereas in the former, we only hit an `elif` when the things above it have failed.  This gives some nice flexibility.  We also get to have a catch-all `else` to make sure that something happens each time, no matter what. \n",

    "## While loops\n",
    "\n",

We keep calling `fit_data()` assigning its output to _converged_.  We do this as many times as it takes to have it return `True`.  Once it's `True`, _not converged_ is false, so we don't enter the loop again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The astute among you may have noticed a potential problem.  What if `fit_data()` never returns `True`? We have an infinite loop and the program will hang.  \n",

    "\n",

    "count = 0\n",

    "    count += 1\n",

    "    count += 1  \n",
    "print ('ran {0} times'.format(count))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first one, we make use of the `break` statement.  `break` will bail out of any loop you're in now - in this case, jumping to that `print` line.  In the second version,  we have two checks on entering the loop each time -- if we've not converged and if we've not run it 10 times.  If both of those are true (the `and` statement), we enter the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, Python has a syntax you don't see very often:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "while CONDITION:\n",
    "    stuff\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    other_stuff\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, _other_stuff_ gets executed when the _condition_ is `False`.  So, if we don't enter the loop (_condition_ starts off as `False`) or when it's done.  Note, using a `break` will not have the `else` be executed as the _condition_ never went `False`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## For loops\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to go through a loop N times or iterate over every element of something like a list, a `for` loop is your answer.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "    print (animal)\n",

    "```\n",
    "animals = ['dingo','puma','okapi']\n",
    "for animal in animals:\n",

    "animals = ['dingo','puma','okapi']\n",
    "for i in range(len(animals)):\n",
    "    print (animals[i])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With for loops, we have a few commands we've seen before and one new one: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `break` - bail out of the loop (just like with _while_ or _if_ statements)\n",
    "*   `else` - similar to the while-loop - this gets done when the loop is exhausted\n",
    "*   `continue` - jump to next iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "There's one more handy format in for-loop syntax to know.  While being very Phythonic has you avoid things like `for i in range...`, in scientific work, we often need to keep track of an index.

    "# Raising errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you write a function, you should really check to make sure the inputs are valid.  If they're not, you should raise an error.  This allows other bits of code (be it yours or someone else's) to know that things didn't go as planned.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def MyFunc (data):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Remember to write your description\"\"\"\n",
    "    if type(data) is not np.ndarray:\n",
    "        raise TypeError('Must pass in np.array')\n",
    "    if data.ndim != 1:\n",
    "        raise TypeError('Must be a 1D array')\n",
    "    if len(data) < 2:\n",
    "        raise ValueError('Must be at least 2 elements long')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The two kinds of errors we raise here are the most common we'll use.  _TypeError_ and _ValueError_.  There are a number more, but for most of your checking, these will suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering at this point, why go through all this?  Why not just print an error out to the screen?  Well, if your program is running for hours and generting thousands of lines of output on the screen or in a log file, are you really going to see that always? Also, other parts of your code can check to see if these errors have been raised and either bail, or handle them gracefully.   For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    SuperCoolComplexFilter(data)\n",
    "except:\n",
    "    print(\"badness happened - using the simpler filter\")\n",
    "    SimplerReliableFilter(data)\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the program would try to use the `SuperCoolComplexFilter()` but if that had an issue and did a \"raise\" the exception would get passed up and the `try` here would fail. Control then goes to the `except` where we alerting the user (via the print) and using some simpler processing of the data as a result."

    "# Static typing\n",
    "Back in Class 1.2, we mentioned that Python is _dynamtically typed_. That is, the type that a variable holds can change on the fly. It's a big part of what makes Python so easy to use. You don't need to pre-declare what type of info a variable holds and you can change this later on without issue. Great!  What's the downside?\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside is that while it makes some things easier, it makes some things tougher for you as the programmer.  By now, you should know that strings have functions like `upper()`. It sure would be nice if your Python environment were smart enough to know that your variable is a string so when you type the variable name and then a period that all the available functions would appear wouldn't it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python gives you the ability to do this via [type hints](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html). One huge thing to note is that **Python itself doesn't care about these hints**. They are only there for your working environment. They're here to help you and do not affect the actual running of the code at all.  Here's a simple example:"

    "Now, it can get a bit more useful still. You can also say what a function should take as input and also what to expect it to return and you can use this to help debug your code. Look at the cell below.  Do you see errors highighted in red underline?  If not, you'll need to enable the feature. For this to work in VSCode, you'll need to make sure that the Pylance extension is installed (probably is) and you'll need to make sure type checking is enabled. For that, go to your settings (Ctrl-, or Cmd-,) and start typing \"typecheck\".  You should see an entry there that may be set to \"off\".  Set it to at least \"basic\"."
