    "# Problem Set 5: Filtering / smoothing and plotting\n",

    "You'll notice that in the starter code below, I've not only got placeholders for these functions (complete with exact descriptions of what they do), but that I've written some amount of helper functions for you. These will serve as templates for later assignments but here, they will do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first cell has the routines you'll write:\n",
    "\n",
    "`LoadData()`: Loads up some data I made that you can use here and that we'll use later (this is what needs Filter1_data.npz).\n",
    "\n",
    "`TestFiltSpeed()`: Just how long do your routines take? Run this when you've got the two versions of SlidingFilt3 up and working.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ShowSimplePlot()`: Calls on matplotlib to make a basic pre- and post-filtered plot. Uses the data from LoadData by default. Run this once you have SlidingFilt3 working.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second cell has some tests you can run.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll know things are at least mostly working when you can say something like:\n",
    "`SlidingFilt3(test_data)`\n",
    "\n",
    "and it should output:\n",

    "`array([ 3. , 3., 5. , 6.33333333, 8. ])`\n",

    "`array([ 2.33333333, 3.5 , 4.5 , 6.5 , 8.33333333])`\n",
    "\n",
    "Details on the functions you're to write are in their docstrings.  So, get coding and as you write new bits, un-comment the tests in the second cell.  In the end, you should have an output that looks like this:\n",
